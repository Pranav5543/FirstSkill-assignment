# AI Usage Report

This file documents how AI was used while creating the starter scaffold for the Streaming Dashboard assignment.

- Task: Scaffold a minimal Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind project with components, types, and OMDb integration.
- AI assistance: Generated project file structure, TypeScript types, sample server/client React components, utility `lib/omdb.ts` with mock fallback, and docs (`README.md`).
- Prompts: The developer provided the assignment spec and asked for a runnable starter that can be extended and deployed to Vercel.
- Verification: Files were created programmatically; the app is structured to run with an optional `OMDB_API_KEY`.

Vercel / GitHub:

- After confirming the files, push to a GitHub repo and import into Vercel. Add `OMDB_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables if you want live OMDB data.
